## Running the Groq Server

The application uses a Groq proxy server to handle AI-powered recommendations securely. Follow these steps to run the server:

### Prerequisites
1. Obtain a Groq API key from [Groq Cloud](https://console.groq.com)
2. Set up your environment variable:
```sh
# Create a .env file in the root directory
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Starting the Server
Run the Groq server using:
```sh
npm run groq:server
```

### API Endpoints
The Groq server exposes the following endpoint:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `/api/groq` | POST | Main endpoint for AI-powered features |

The endpoint handles the following operations:
- Course Recommendations
- Learning Path Generation
- Quiz Generation
- Skill Assessment

All requests require authentication via the Groq API key.

The server will start on port 4001 by default. You can modify the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

### Server Details
- **Endpoint**: POST `/api/groq`
- **Port**: 4001 (default)
- **CORS**: Enabled for cross-origin requests
- **Authentication**: Requires Groq API key in environment variables

## üçè Apple-Inspired Animated Notifications

This app uses a custom AnimatedToaster notification system with Framer Motion for beautiful, Mac-like bounce and pop effects. Notifications appear in the top-right with glassmorphism, shadow, and smooth transitions.

- Trigger notifications anywhere using the `useAnimatedToaster` hook and `showToast` function.
- Example:
  ```tsx
  const { showToast } = useAnimatedToaster();
  showToast({ type: "success", title: "Welcome!", message: "You have logged in." });
  ```
- Login/logout and other key actions are animated for a delightful user experience.

### Custom Animation
- Notification entrance: bounce-in
- Icon: pop-in
- Fully responsive and dark mode ready

### How to Customize
- Edit `src/components/ui/AnimatedToaster.tsx` for logic and style.
- Animation CSS is in `src/index.css`.
- Place the `<AnimatedToaster toasts={toasts} />` component at the root of your app.
